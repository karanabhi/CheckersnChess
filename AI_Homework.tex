\section*{Problem 1}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item  There are 9 choices for the 1st move, 8 for the 2nd move, 7 for the 3rd move, etc., giving us an upper bound of 9! = 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 362880. But this is an overestimate, because some games end in 5, 6, 7 or 8 moves. The true ﬁgure is actually 255168. If we take symmetry into account, the number reduces substancially. For example, there are now only 3 choices for the ﬁrst move and at most 5 choices for the second move. In fact, the total is reduced to 26830 distinct games, of which 172 end in 5 moves, 579 end in 6 moves, 5115 end in 7 moves, 7426 end in 8 moves, 8670 result in a win in 9 moves and 4868 result in a draw.

\section*{Problem 2}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item 
function AND-OR-GRAPH-SEARCH(problem) returns a conditional plan, or failure 
OR-SEARCH(problem.INITIAL-STATE, problem, [ ])
function OR-SEARCH(state, problem, path) returns a conditional plan, or failure
if problem.GOAL-TEST(state) then return the empty plan
if state is on path then return failure
for each action in problem.ACTIONS(state) do
plan AND-SEARCH(RESULTS(state, action), problem, [state | path])
if plan 6= failure then return [action | plan]
return failure
function AND-SEARCH(states, problem, path) returns a conditional plan, or failure
for each s(i) in states do:\\
plan(i) OR-SEARCH(s(i), problem, path)
if plan(i) = failure then return failure
return [if s1 then plan1
else if s2 then plan2
else if s(n1) then plan(n)1
else plan(n)]

For slippery world, the graph shows corresponding conditions of going sucking one
or both the blocks in AND.For erratic world, the graph shows AND condition of stay-
ing back or moving to the next block.
